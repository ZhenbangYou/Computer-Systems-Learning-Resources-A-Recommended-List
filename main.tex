\section{Preliminary}

\textbf{Disclaimer}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This list focuses on \emph{breadth} rather than \emph{depth}.
    \item This text mainly focuses on \emph{software systems}, with less concentration on topics such as \emph{VLSI}, \emph{storage systems}, and \emph{embedded systems}, although these are mentioned in some of the following resources.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Directions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The most fundamental components of computer systems are:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Computer Architecture
        \item Operating Systems (OS)
        \item Computer Networks
        \item Compilers
        \item Programming Languages (PL)
    \end{enumerate}
    Master them before moving on to other parts.
    
    Section 2-9 is the core of this list.
    \item The resources in each section are list in an order \emph{suitable for learning}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If time is limited, you may just read the first (or the first few) books, and move on to the next section.
        \item To understand some advanced books, knowledge of subsequent sections may be required.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The references help you identify the \emph{authors} rather than \emph{latest versions}.
    \item Given the rapid development of computer science, always read the latest version.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tip: search \emph{Amazon} for the latest version. The version number in this text may be outdated with new publications.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{How to Read an Abstruse Book?}\\
Three passes.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Fast: get the main idea and leave out all the details.
    \item Exhaustive: understanding the logic and virtually all the details; few really difficult points can be left out.
    \item Deep: raise questions, and focus on interesting or difficult points.
\end{enumerate}
Here is a famous paper called ``How to Read a Paper" which discusses a similar issue:\\
\href{https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs245/readings/how-to-read-a-paper.pdf}{https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs245/readings/how-to-read-a-paper.pdf}

~

\noindent
\textbf{Why do you recommend so many resources about application?}\\
Learn how to use it before learning how to build it.

~

\noindent
\textbf{Prerequisites}

        \item Elements of \emph{stochastic processes}, especially some basic conclusions and corollaries, are helpful.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Logic, Automata and Complexity
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{What if I want more?}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Search for more courses offered by top universities.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{How to find them?}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item For a given university, search for its course list (note that the keyword you are searching for may not appear in the course names).\\
            Example:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Stanford:
                \href{https://cs.stanford.edu/academicz/courses}{https://cs.stanford.edu/academicz/courses}
                \item UC Berkeley:
                \href{https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS/}{https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS/}
                \item MIT:
                \href{http://catalog.mit.edu/subjects/6/}{http://catalog.mit.edu/subjects/6/}
            \end{itemize}
            \item To save time by scanning the entire course list, you can find the curriculum or program sheet of the Bachelor's/Master's degree.\\
            Example:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Stanford Computer Science Master's Program Sheets:\\
                \href{https://cs.stanford.edu/academicz/current-masters/masters-program-sheets/programsheets}{https://cs.stanford.edu/academicz/current-masters/masters-program-sheets/programsheets}
                \item UC Berkeley CS Major Degree Requirements (Undergraduate):
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item Lower Division:\\
                    \href{https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/cs/degree-reqs-lowerdiv}{https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/cs/degree-reqs-lowerdiv}
                    \item Upper Division:\\
                    \href{https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/cs/degree-reqs-upperdiv}{https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/cs/degree-reqs-upperdiv}
                \end{enumerate}
            \end{itemize}
            \item The naming convention of course numbers helps you save time.
        \end{enumerate}
        Besides, courses provide \emph{practice} opportunities, which is key to learning computer systems.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Find cross-cutting areas like machine learning systems.
    You can always find cutting-edge technologies and research hotspots here.
    Besides, computer systems are extremely powerful when different modules work together.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Again, searching for advanced courses helps you discover these areas!
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\textbf{How to Avoid Forgetting?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Repetition (multiple passes)
    \item Practice
    \item Questioning
    \item Discussion
\end{itemize}

\section{Computer Architecture}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware-Software Interface\\
    (5th Edition \cite{patterson2013computerMIPS}/RISC-V Edition \cite{pattersoncomputerRV}/ARM Edition \cite{patterson2016computerARM})
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The original version is based on MIPS.
        RISC-V version is recommended; after reading this version, you may proceed on ARM version which is a good book for learning ARM.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Digital Design and Computer Architecture\\
    (2nd Edition \cite{harris2015digitalMIPS}/RISC-V Edition \cite{harris2021digitalRV}/ARM Edition \cite{harris2015digitalARM})
    \begin{itemize}
        \item You may just read Chap 1-5.
        \item The original version is based on MIPS.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The RISC-V Reader An Open Architecture Atlas \cite{patterson2017risc}
    \item Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach (6th Edition) \cite{hennessy2018computer}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item You may leave out appendices the first time you read this book.
        \item Difficult as it may be, this book is just ``the second book for novices".
        If you want to have a deep understanding of a specific topic, do go to read official tutorials/documentations such as those of NVIDIA.
        \item When having some experiences on \emph{parallel computing}, read corresponding chapters of this book again, you will surely gain some new understanding.
        \item Based on my personal experiences, multiple passes are needed to gain thorough comprehension of this masterpiece.
    \end{itemize}
    \item RISC-V Privileged Architecture (slides)\\
    \href{https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/riscv-privileged-BCN.v7-2.pdf}{https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/riscv-privileged-BCN.v7-2.pdf}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A wonderful slide on RISC-V privileged architecture, as well as the core problem ``what is the privileged architecture".

    \end{itemize}
    \item A New Golden Age for Computer Architecture (a Turing Lecture with full text)\\
    \href{https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/2/234352-a-new-golden-age-for-computer-architecture/fulltext}{https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/2/234352-a-new-golden-age-for-computer-architecture/fulltext}

        \item four passes to learn \emph{OS}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item How to use: user/programmer's perspective, top-down.
                This pass is assisted by CSAPP and resources about \emph{Linux Programming}.
                \item How to build (build a usable one): builder's perspective, bottom-up.
                \item How to design (build a good one if there is no compatibility issues): both perspectives.
                This pass can only be down with knowledge of all the major parts of computer systems.
                \item Advanced and cross-cutting issues:
                \emph{distributed systems}, \emph{cloud computing},...
            \end{enumerate}
        \item Always think about the interaction and cooperation between
        \begin{itemize}
            \item OS \& hardware,
            \item OS \& computer networks,
            \item OS \& PL,
            \item OS \& DB.
        \end{itemize}
        Also think about whether their boundary can be and should be redefined.
        
        \textbf{DO NOT} overfit \emph{Linux}!
        Not everything of it is reasonable and well-suited to the current need!

\subsection{Language List}

\textbf{Suggestions for Learning Order}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Start with functional languages, since they do not need to take \emph{memory} into account, which is always confusing and error-prone for beginners.
    Besides, functional programming lets you pay more attention to the description of computation rather than its implementation; this is really a blessing.
    \item Which functional language to choose?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{Lisp} family is too stale and outdated.
        \item Purely functional languages like \emph{Haskell} is also not appropriate.
        Think about the effort needed to understand \emph{monad}!
        \item \emph{Scala} is not good too, due to its complex syntax, although being fairly modern.
        \item The only remaining choice seems to be \emph{ML} family, of which \emph{OCaml} and \emph{F\#} are both great. \emph{F\#} is more modern and easier to learn, and the OOP in F\# is more mature.
        \item However, starting from \emph{ML} family sounds a little horrendous.
        \item Consider learning \emph{Kotlin} first, for its simplicity and modernity, and being functional enough except the lack of full support for pattern matching.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item With the foundations of \emph{Kotlin} and \emph{OCaml/F\#}, it is easy to learn virtually all the mainstream languages like \emph{Java}, \emph{TypeScript}, and even \emph{Scala} (although this one obviously requires more effort than the previous two); besides, you can also advance towards \emph{Rust} (time-consuming!), and after that, the legendary \emph{C++}.
    If \emph{Rust} is too hard for you, try \emph{Go} first.
\end{enumerate}


\textbf{Tips}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{General tips for choosing an IDE}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For languages running on \emph{JVM}, choose \emph{JetBrains}.
        \item If \emph{JetBrains} has a specific software for the language your target language, prefer it.
        \item Otherwise, \emph{VS Code} is always a nice choice.
    \end{enumerate}
        Only IDEs I have used will be listed here, so there may be other wonderful IDEs.
    \item \textbf{General tips for choosing platforms for \emph{Windows} users}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For languages on \emph{.NET}, \emph{Windows} is obviously the best.
        \item Otherwise, \emph{WSL2} is at least not worse than \emph{Windows}.
        \item For old AOT (ahead-of-time) compiled languages like \emph{C/C++}, \emph{OCaml}, and \emph{Haskell}, \emph{Windows} may be a disaster (lots of compatibility issues).
        \item For JIT (just-in-time) compiled languages and modern AOT compiled languages such as \emph{Go} and \emph{Rust}, it does not matter which one you choose.
        \item \emph{Python} is a special case where the compatibility of \emph{Windows} is not good enough sometimes.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Development toolchains matter.}
    
    You need not only \emph{compilers}, \emph{libraries} and \emph{IDE}, but also \emph{build tools}, \emph{debuggers}, \emph{test tools}, \emph{linters}, and even \emph{sanitizers}, \emph{profilers}, \emph{formatters}, etc.
    
    \item \textbf{Frameworks} are key components of the ecosystem of a PL.
    Success of some PL highly relies on the its frameworks.
    \item Sometimes \textbf{searching within a tutorial/documentation} gives better answer than \emph{Google}.
    \item Unless specified explicitly, always try the latest version.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{C/C++} (Do learn the latest version of C++, or at least C++17)
    
    If possible, learn \emph{Rust} first.

            In this case, \emph{Boost} may provide additional useful functionality.
            Besides, some functionality of \emph{Boost} may be incorporated into \emph{standard C++ libraries} in the future, as the past shows.

        \item Microsoft C\# documentation:
        \href{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/}{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/}
    \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Scala} (\emph{Scala 3} is out!)\\
    
    \emph{Scala} borrows more from \emph{Haskell} than \emph{OCaml}.
    
    Prerequisite languages: Java (if you find \emph{Scala} too difficult to learn, try \emph{Kotlin} first).
    
    Noteworthy features: FP.
    
    Multi-paradigmatic languages like \emph{Scala}, \emph{OCaml} and \emph{F\#} are great starting points to learn \emph{functional programming}, since your programming style can transition gradually from \emph{imperative programming} to \emph{functional programming}.

        For the sake of ecosystem, currently \emph{Scala 2} is preferred.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Kotlin}
    
    In my mind, it is the best language for entry-level programmers.
    
    Prerequisite languages: none.
    
    Try \emph{Scala} and \emph{Kotlin} together.
    
    Noteworthy features: null safety, modest FP.

    \item \textbf{Rust}
    
    \emph{A extremely high-performance, memory-safe language without garbage collection}
    
    Most of the features of Rust can be found in either \emph{C++} or \em{OCaml}; therefore, solid foundations of these two languages does help you understand the design of Rust.
    
    Which one to learn first, C++ or Rust?
    Due to the popularity of C++, most people were exposed to it before hearing of Rust.
    However, the design of Rust is more consistent and cleaner, less prone to be misused, also without the horrendous legacy of C++.
    Thus, I believe Rust is worth learning before C++.

        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{OCaml} (\emph{OCaml} 5.0 with \emph{multicore support} is coming!)
    
    \emph{ML}, the ancestor of \emph{OCaml}, is a programming language that won his creator a Turing Award, for it is ``the first language to include polymorphic type inference together with a type-safe exception-handling mechanism".
    
    Prerequisite languages: none.\\
    Familiarity with \emph{Scala} is very helpful.
    
    Comparison with \emph{Scala}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{Scala} is more like a hybrid of \emph{imperative programming} and \emph{functional programming}.
        However, \emph{functional programming} and \emph{imperative programming} take the primary and secondary positions in \emph{OCaml} respectively.
        
        \item \emph{Type inference} of \emph{OCaml} is even more powerful than that of \emph{Scala}, e.g., in \emph{Scala}, you need to specify the types of function arguments and the return types of recursive functions.
        
        \item \emph{Scala} allows \emph{implicit casting}, which is absolutely impossible in \emph{OCaml}.
        The type system of \emph{OCaml} is rather strict and rigor.
    \end{enumerate}
    If you have learned either one of them, I strongly recommend you learn the other.

            \begin{itemize}
                \item \emph{OCaml} is one of few PL that attach great importance to \textbf{performance}, which is especially rare in \emph{functional language}.
                Fortunately, this book also gives introduction to the implementation of \emph{OCaml}, in particular, temporal and spatial cost.
                These contents are really instructive, in that functional programmers often know little about these.
                \item This book is written by people at Jane Street.
                Therefore, the book turns out to be practical rather than theoretical or mathematical as you may expect books about FP will do.

    \item \textbf{F\#}
    
    \emph{F\#} is quite similar to \emph{OCaml}, and it runs on the \emph{.NET} platform.
    Due to their similarity, once you have mastered either of them, it will be easy to learn the other.
    
    \emph{Which one to learn first? OCaml or F\#?}
    
    Either can be a good choice. For beginners, they are both good alternatives to each other. F\# is more modern, thus handier and free from the stale syntax of OCaml.

    \item \textbf{Haskell}\\
    \emph{Purely functional language}.\\

    Notable features:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item purity \& laziness,
        \item type class \& type system,
        \item monad \& algebraic design.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    Knowledge of programming language theory does help appreciating the elegance of this wonderful language. Personally, I could not understand some of the most elegant design until taking Stanford CS 242.
    
    Prerequisite languages: none.\\
    Recommended learning order:
    \emph{OCaml/F\#} $\rightarrow$ \emph{Scala} $\rightarrow$ \emph{Haskell}.
    
    Key differences between \emph{OCaml} and \emph{Haskell}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Purity,
        \item Laziness.
        \item \emph{Haskell} supports \emph{type classes} and \emph{type families}.
        \item \emph{OCaml} is more rigorous, e.g., partial functions are allowed in \emph{Haskell} while prohibited in \emph{OCaml}.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \emph{Haskell} is known for its steep learning curve, an appropriate learning order provides you sufficient foundations to conquer it.

\subsection{Functional Programming}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Books
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Recommended for green hands
        
        \emph{These books teach not only the syntax of FP, but (and more importantly) how to design software in the functional style, as well as the background and the origin of those functional features.}
        \begin{enumerate}
    \item Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (2nd Edition \cite{abelson1996structure}/JavaScript Edition \cite{abelson2022structure})
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The original version is based on \textbf{Scheme}, an Lisp dialect.
            However, Lisp and its dialects are obsolete now.
            But the book is still well worth recommending.
            \item The significance of the book goes well beyond teaching us functional programming.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Functional Programming in Scala
    \cite{chiusano2014functional}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The 1st version is based on \emph{Scala 2}, while the second version is based on \emph{Scala 3}.
                Except for this, these two versions are basically the same.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Purely Functional Data Structures
        \cite{okasaki1999purely}
        \item Other books
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Java 8 in Action: Lambdas, Streams, and Functional-style Programming (1st Edition) \cite{urma2014java}
                \item All books about \emph{Haskell} and \emph{OCaml}.
            \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Suggested learning order in terms of languages
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Start from \emph{OCaml/F\#}. This is the cleanest one. Personally, I think \emph{F\#} is better.
        \item Move on to \emph{Scala}. It has a lot more features and programming paradigms than \emph{OCaml/F\#}, thus harder to learn and prone to get confused. However, \textbf{trait} (\textbf{type class} in \emph{Haskell}) is very helpful for learning functional design, which is missing in \emph{OCaml} but present in \emph{F\#} (although it can be emulated by modules in \emph{OCaml}). Besides, since \emph{Scala} derives from \emph{Haskell}, it is helpful for you to learn the latter.
        \item At this point, you may try some languages with lots of functional features like \emph{Rust}.
        \item Then you can start challenge yourself with the legendary \emph{Haskell}. If your foundation of the previous stuffs is solid enough, it will not be so scary for you to learn this language. From the perspective of the programming language theory, it does possess some nice properties like \emph{termination} (if any evaluation order leads to termination, then natural order, adopted by \emph{Haskell}, will terminate).
        \end{enumerate}

            \item Computer Architecture
            \item Compilers
            \item Operating systems
            \item One OOP language  (\emph{Java} is OK, but \emph{C++}/\emph{Python} is not enough), one FP language.
            Basic knowledge suffices.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Personally, I recommend \emph{Scala/OCaml/F\#} (personally I think F\# is the best) + \emph{Rust}.
                They cover almost all the programming paradigms in modern and frequently used languages.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}    
\end{itemize}
    \textbf{Suggestions}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item No need to master an entire PL in one shot; instead, study part of it when needed.
            \item PLs develop rapidly. To catch up with the latest development, refer to online documentations/tutorials/blogs besides books.
            \item Mastered at least one \emph{modern} language in each of the following paradigms:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Procedural
                \item Object-Oriented
                \item Functional
            \end{itemize}
            Note that modern languages like \emph{Go}, \emph{Scala}, \emph{Kotlin} and \emph{Rust} can be greatly different than old ones like \emph{Java} and \emph{Python}.
            As a special case, although modern \emph{C++} (C++11 and later) is really modern, but there are inevitably a great number of legacies, so C++ can be considered as a mixture.
            \item PL can be viewed from at least three perspectives:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Computer systems
                \item Software engineering
                \item Software theory
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item e.g., relationship between programming paradigms and Church-Turing thesis.
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
            Therefore, you can always find lots of cross-cutting issues in PL.
            \item A complete list of \emph{programming paradigms}:\\
            \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming\_paradigm}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming\_paradigm}
            \item Pay attention to three kinds of \emph{safety}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Type safety
                \item Memory safety
                \item Thread safety
            \end{itemize}
            \item Pay attention to the \emph{memory consistency model} (always called \emph{memory model} in this context) of each language, although this virtually has no impact on \emph{application-level programming}.
            \item \emph{Concrete examples} always help a lot for understanding \emph{abstract concepts}, and this is also one of the reasons why you should master several languages.
            \item Pay attention to the interoperation between a certain language with C/C++ (and languages on JVM with Java).
        \end{itemize}

\section{Parallel Computing}
\emph{Parallel computing} consists of three components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Architecture (system)
    \item Programming (application)
    \item Algorithms (theory)
\end{itemize}
\emph{Parallel computing} is an natural extension to \emph{computer architecture}.\\
\textbf{Special Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Do read \emph{Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach (CAAQA)} before diving into this, and revisit that masterpiece after having some hands-on experience of parallel computing!
    \item \emph{Parallel Computing} without \emph{Memory Optimization} is \textbf{ridiculous}!
    \item Do learn how to analyze performance bottleneck, which is key to the success of parallel programs.
    Knowledge like that of \emph{computer architecture} and \emph{operating systems} can be extremely helpful.
    \item \emph{Parallel computing} should include \emph{distributed computing}; however, the latter is not involved in this section.

\subsection{Categories}\\
The essence of \emph{parallel computing} is \emph{the lack of dependencies}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item ILP (Instruction-Level Parallelism)\\
    Mathematical model of ILP -- DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Node: a stage of a instruction.
        \item Edge: dependency (data dependency, control dependency, name dependency) between a pair of nodes.
    \end{itemize}
    Goal:
    eliminate dependencies (edges), and exploit the lack of dependencies between nodes.
    \item DLP (Data-Level Parallelism)\\
        The essence of DLP programming: \emph{Vectorization}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item To get some hands-on experiences with this, you may start with \emph{PyTorch}, since this relieves you from some low-level details like remaining elements and memory hierarchy.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Official tutorial: \href{https://pytorch.org/tutorials/}{https://pytorch.org/tutorials/}
                \item Also, \textbf{PyTorch} is a convenient tool to exploit GPU for parallel computing.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item TLP (Thread-Level Parallelism)\\
    The essence of TLP programming: \textbf{async} (concurrent control flow), \textbf{await} (synchronization).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Concurrency mechanisms
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Thread: nearly all mainstrean languages support this, e.g., C++ std::thread/jthread, Java, pthread
            \item Future/Promise: most of mainstrean languages support this,  e.g., Scala, C++, Java
            \item Stackful Coroutine: Go
            \item Stackless Coroutine: Kotlin, Rust (async/await, Tokio), F\# (async/task), Haskell
        \end{enumerate}
        \textbf{Aside}:
        \begin{enumerate}
                \item Here is a good summary of \emph{Asynchronous programming techniques} provided in the tutorial of \emph{Kotlin}:
            \href{https://kotlinlang.org/docs/async-programming.html}{https://kotlinlang.org/docs/async-programming.html}
            \item The essence of \emph{Asynchronous Programming} is \emph{async/await}, as well as \emph{suspension points}.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item For \emph{Threads} and \emph{Stackful Coroutines}, every point is a suspension point, while for \emph{Stackless Coroutines}, only a fraction of points can be suspension points and they are declared explicitly.
            \end{itemize}
            \item For implementations, figure out what is ``\textbf{continuation}" and how it varies in \emph{Processes}, \emph{Threads}, \emph{Stackful Coroutines}, and \emph{Stackless Coroutines}.
            Also think about the relation between \emph{continuation} and \emph{suspension points}.
        \end{enumerate}

        \item Synchronization mechanisms
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Shared memory
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Mutex, Condition Variable: most languages.
                \item Monitor: Java.
                For C++, this can be readily emulated by \emph{RAII}.
                \item Atomic variables/operations: most languages.
                \item Barrier: most languages, especially popular in data parallel programming like CUDA.
                \item Read Write Lock: most languages.
                \item Software Transactional Memory: Haskell.
            \end{enumerate}
            Many widely used mechanisms are not listed here.

                    \end{itemize}
            \end{enumerate}
            \item High-level encapsulations
            \begin{enumerate}

        \item Aside -- comparison among \emph{concurrency}, \emph{parallelism}, \emph{asynchrony}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Concurrency: when multiple computations execute in overlapping time periods.
            \item Parallelism: when multiple computations or several parts of a single computation run at exactly the same time.
            \item Asynchrony: when one or more computations can execute separately from the main program flow.
        \end{enumerate}

\section{Database (DB)}
\textbf{Special Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Think about the relationship (cooperation and conflicts) between DB and OS.
    Also, when facing the same issues (there are lots of them) like concurrency control, how do they handle them respectively?
    \item \emph{Parallel and distributed databases} and \emph{NoSQL} are the hotspots nowadays.
    Do place emphasis on them!
    \item View DB from a full-stack perspective, that is, from systems, to applications, to theory (relation algebra).
    Lots of knowledge you have learned elsewhere plays an important role here.
    Also, you can find plenty of cross-cutting issues here.
    \item Pay attention to the relationship between DB and big data/data mining.

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item When studying query languages, reason about \emph{declarative programming} (e.g., \emph{SQL}) and \emph{logic programming} (e.g., \emph{Datalog}).
            (Aside: \emph{logic programming} is a subset of \emph{declarative programming}.)

    \item Prerequisites:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Compulsory:
        \begin{enumerate}

            \item Operating systems
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Recommended:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Computer architecture
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Lots of similar ideas in \emph{databases} can be found in \emph{computer architecture})
            \end{itemize}
            \item Computer networks
            \begin{itemize}
                \item required for learning \emph{parallel and distributed databases})

            \item Programming languages
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Query languages help deepening our understanding of differences among programming paradigms (e.g., \emph{imperative} vs \emph{declarative}), as well as some feasible but rarely used programming paradigms (e.g., \emph{logic programming}).
            \end{itemize}
        \end{enumerate}
        \item A few words about \emph{distributed systems}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item It is quite hard to determine which one of the following should be learned first: \emph{parallel and distributed databases} and \emph{distributed systems}.
            My personal feeling is, study of these two fields can be interleaved, since you often need knowledge of the other field when studying either one field.
            As a always reasonable method, study them multiple times so that you will not miss important prerequisite knowledge, if the optimal order of learning is hard to figure out.
        \end{itemize}
        \item PL

            \item Java: JDBC.

        \item The first book plays a primary role, while the second is supplementary (however, I still recommend you read it).
        \item These two books are relatively \textbf{obsolete} (sorry I did not find any relevant modern book).
        Besides, there are lots of academic errors in the first book.
        \item These two books cover lots of knowledge.
        Pick the chapters you need.
        There is no need to read every chapter.
